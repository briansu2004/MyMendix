# Microflow vs Nanoflow vs Workflow

Mendix is a low-code application development platform that allows users to build web and mobile applications with minimal hand-coding. In Mendix, different types of flows are used to define the logic and behavior of an application. Here are the differences between Workflow, Microflow, and Nanoflow in Mendix:

1. **Workflow:**
   - A Workflow in Mendix represents a series of activities or tasks that need to be executed in a specific order.
   - Workflows are typically used to model and manage high-level business processes within an application.
   - Workflows can involve human interactions and may include steps such as approvals, reviews, and manual tasks.
   - They provide a way to structure and visualize the overall flow of a business process.

2. **Microflow:**
   - A Microflow is a smaller, more granular unit of logic within Mendix applications.
   - Microflows define the behavior of specific actions or events within the application.
   - They are used to model business logic, such as calculations, validations, and data manipulations.
   - Microflows are often associated with user interactions, events, or triggered by buttons, links, or other UI elements.
   - They can be simple or complex, depending on the requirements of the application.

3. **Nanoflow:**
   - A Nanoflow is a lightweight and more specialized version of a Microflow.
   - Nanoflows are designed to be used in responsive web applications and are optimized for client-side execution.
   - They are typically used for small, reusable pieces of logic that need to be executed on the client side without making a round trip to the server.
   - Nanoflows are especially useful in situations where real-time responsiveness is crucial, such as in mobile applications or dynamic web interfaces.

In summary, while Workflows are high-level representations of business processes, Microflows and Nanoflows are more focused on defining the logic and behavior of specific parts of an application. Microflows are versatile and can handle a wide range of logic, while Nanoflows are optimized for client-side execution in responsive web applications.
