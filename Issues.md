## Low Code Pros vs Cons

More cons than pros

- Very slow: installation (40+ minutes), import, publish
- Very inconvenience
- Not easy to customize
- "Low Code" / "No Code" but the Studio Pro gives us an IDE
- Integrate with Eclipse instead of VSCode or IntelliJ
- ...

## Big problems on syncing the local Studio Pro and Web UI "My Apps"

- Can only "delete" the apps in Web UI, can't do it in local Studio Pro!
- Local Studio App doesn't have the "refresh" feature - it doesn't sync the apps automatically.

## "My Apps" should group installed apps with the Studio Pro versions (given the common incompatiable issues)
