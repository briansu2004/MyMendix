- Workflow: Nanoflow vs microflow4

Nanoflows are the native mobile equivalent of microflows, but with several key differences. Nanoflows are based on JavaScript, and they are offline-first. This means they can execute without an online data connection, and they execute on mobile devices instead of the server. Therefore, certain functionality - like calling a REST API, which is available in microflows - is not available in nanoflows.
