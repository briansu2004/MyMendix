## My Mendix Project

### Designed and created Mendix applications for client Canada Post

- Talked with multiple legacy application teams and composed the very detailed solution design documents from high level to low level
- Used Mendix Studio to create the responsive and feature-rich UI apps with the low code concept for mobile, pad and computer terminals, deployed the apps to Mendix cloud, built the images with Cloud Foundry, managed the entire application lifecycle, and collaborated with the team with Agile, Scrum and user stories.
- Migrated the business data from various legacy applications to Big Data with the initial load and ongoing delta loads
