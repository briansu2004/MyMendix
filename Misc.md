## Glyphicon

Glyphicons are a set of icon fonts provided by the Bootstrap framework, a popular front-end framework for web development. Bootstrap includes a wide range of scalable vector icons, and these icons are collectively referred to as Glyphicons.

Glyphicons can be used to enhance the visual appeal and usability of web applications. They are often used for common actions or elements such as navigation bars, buttons, and other user interface components. The icons are designed to be easily scalable and customizable using CSS.

In Bootstrap, you can use Glyphicons by adding the appropriate CSS classes to HTML elements. For example:

```html
<!-- Using a glyphicon for a button -->
<button type="button" class="btn btn-default">
  <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-search" aria-hidden="true"></span> Search
</button>
```

In this example, the "glyphicon glyphicon-search" class is applied to a `<span>` element within a button, creating a button with a search icon.

It's worth noting that starting with Bootstrap 4, Glyphicons were dropped from the default package. However, you can still use them by including a separate Bootstrap Icons library or by manually integrating Glyphicons into your project. Always check the specific version and documentation of Bootstrap or any other library you are using for the most accurate information.
