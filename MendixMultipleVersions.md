# Why I need install multiple versions?

I've installed Mendix Studio Pro v10.6.1, v9.19.0 and v8.18.27.

Installing multiple versions of Mendix Studio Pro may be necessary for a variety of reasons, depending on your specific development and project requirements. Here are some common scenarios where having multiple versions installed could be beneficial:

1. **Project Compatibility:** Different versions of Mendix Studio Pro may be required for compatibility with specific Mendix app projects. If you are working on projects developed with different Mendix versions, having the corresponding Studio Pro versions installed allows you to open and edit those projects without any compatibility issues.

2. **App Lifecycle:** Mendix applications have a lifecycle, and as Mendix evolves, there may be changes in the platform. Some projects might be developed on older versions due to various reasons, and updating them to the latest Mendix version might require gradual steps. Having multiple versions installed facilitates working on projects at different stages of the Mendix lifecycle.

3. **Mendix Updates:** Mendix regularly releases updates with new features, improvements, and bug fixes. Some projects may require specific versions of Mendix Studio Pro to take advantage of the latest features or to ensure stability with a known version that has been thoroughly tested.

4. **Collaboration:** If you are collaborating with a team or working on projects with different teams, having multiple versions installed allows everyone to work on their projects without the need for constant version switching.

5. **Testing and Quality Assurance:** In some cases, you may need to test your Mendix applications on different Mendix versions to ensure they work correctly across various environments. Installing multiple versions enables you to perform testing and quality assurance for your applications on different Mendix releases.

Before installing multiple versions, it's essential to check the Mendix documentation and release notes to understand any potential compatibility issues or specific requirements for each version. Additionally, consider the disk space requirements and system resources needed for running multiple instances of Mendix Studio Pro on your development machine.
